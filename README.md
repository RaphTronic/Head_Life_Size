# Mannequin Head 3D Files

Took me way too long to find, modify and print a life size human head, for a mask project.

So I decided to document the journey and publish the files in case it helps someone else. Details in this blog post: https://raphtronic.blogspot.com/2024/12/mannequin-head-life-size-3d-print.html

The original head model is from lehthanis: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:758647

Feel free to copy / remix / whatever my files.

Happy modeling and printing to all !

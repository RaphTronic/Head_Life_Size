# Mannequin Head 3D Files

Took me way too long to find, modify and print a life size human head, for a mask project.

So I decided to document the journey and publish the files in case it helps someone else. Details in this blog post:

Feel free to copy, remix, whatever.

Happy modeling and printing to all !
